# CraterChat
A chat and commands mod for [Cosmic Reach](https://finalforeach.itch.io/cosmic-reach) using the [Cosmic Quilt Mod Loader](https://codeberg.org/CRModders/cosmic-quilt)

## Downloading and installing
I recommend using the [Multiverse Launcher](https://discord.com/channels/1198501071363002408/1221807102830448802/1221807102830448802) (Join the [Cosmic Reach Discord](https://discord.gg/3Vc8puFk9Z) to view) as it allows you to choose which game version and mod loader version you want, which is very ideal for playing with mods.
Download [brigadier-1.0.18.jar](https://github.com/InsertSoda/CraterChat/raw/master/dependencies/brigadier-1.0.18.jar) and the CraterChat mod jar and put them into the mods folder. Now you can start the game.
